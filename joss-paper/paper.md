# Summary

Gonum provides tools enabling scientific research through consistent,
composable and comprehensible scientific code.
Gonum aims to be the equivalent of NumPy/SciPy but for the Go programming
language.

Gonum strives to deliver code that run fast (as fast as C/C++ or Fortran)
and code that is as easy to write as in Matlab, R or Python.
Gonum is still being actively developed but already offers a solid set of
packages, providing matrices and linear algebra; statistics functions,
probability distributions and sampling routines; finding the extrema of functions; and tools to compute numerical derivatives.
